# qpurge
A shell script to delete any files with certain names. Non-Case-Sensitive and very dangerous. Was mostly used to figure out bash scripts and different selection options like -h or -v

# Installation

#### Commands
```shell

## Copy the file "qpurge" into your ~/usr/bin/ directory and give it permissions by entering this command in the basic console 
```shell
chmod +x ~/usr/bin/qpurge
```
